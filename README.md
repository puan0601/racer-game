# racer-game
**Technologies** used: HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, Bootstrap.

This is my attempt at an interesting twist on the sideways racer. You are prompted with a random button to push to advance your Player. First one to reach the final position wins!!

Future improvements:
* Implement stop game when there is a winner.
* Real-time leaderboard during race.
* Win counter for multiple racing.
* Customizable track length.
